=== Question marks in scalars
--- from: @perlpunk
--- tags: scalar

Modified by bredd to remove tests in flow format but preserve those in block format.
(FileMeta.org/Yaml doesn't support flow format)

--- in-yaml(<)
    - a?string
    - another ? string
    - key: value?
    - ?string
    - string?

--- in-json
[
  "a?string",
  "another ? string",
  {
    "key": "value?"
  },
  "?string",
  "string?"
]
