=== Plain multiline key
--- from: @perlpunk
--- tags: error mapping

Modified by bredd to validate plain multiline key.
The original checked that multiline keys caused an error report but multiline
keys work well in the FileMeta.org/Yaml parser. A future version may
deliberately detect this case and prohibit it in which case the original
2CMS.tml test will be restored.

--- in-yaml
this
 is
  valid: x

--- in-json
{
  "this is valid": "x"
}
